 ## Denylist Behavior:
 * The denylist is ALWAYS active, blocking potentially interactive or sensitive commands.
 * Command matching is based on prefix.
 * Commands are normalized to ensure only full command groups are matched (e.g., \`app\` matches \`app deploy\` but not \`apphub\`).
 * When a GA (General Availability) command is on the denylist, all its release tracks (e.g., alpha, beta) are also denied.`;
